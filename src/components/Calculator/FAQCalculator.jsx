    question: "What is the trading calculator?",
    answer: "The trading calculator is a tool that helps you estimate essential trading metrics such as margin, spread cost, swap rates, commission, and pip value before placing a trade."
  },
  {
    question: "What do the terms of the trading calculator results mean?",
    answer: "Terms like margin, pip value, swap, and spread cost refer to the financial details of your trade. Margin is the capital required to open a position. Spread cost is the difference between bid and ask. Pip value shows profit/loss per pip movement."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is Leverage disabled for some instruments?",
    answer: "Leverage might be disabled or limited due to regulatory restrictions or the inherent risk associated with specific instruments like stocks or volatile assets."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the trading calculator?",
    answer: "The trading calculator gives close estimates based on current spreads and trading conditions. Actual results may vary slightly based on market fluctuations at the time of execution."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I account for different investment scenarios with the calculator?",
    answer: "Yes. By adjusting the input parameters like lot size, leverage, and account type, you can simulate different trading scenarios to understand their impact."
  },
  {
    question: "How to calculate pips?",
    answer: "Pips are calculated as the smallest price movement in a currency pair. For most pairs, 1 pip = 0.0001. Multiply pip value by the number of lots to determine your gain/loss."
  },
  {
    question: "What is pip value?",
    answer: "Pip value is the monetary worth of a one-pip movement in a trading position. It depends on your lot size, the instrument, and your account currency."
  },
  {
    question: "What are long and short swaps?",
    answer: "Swaps are rollover interest rates charged or earned for holding a position overnight. Long swaps apply to buy trades and short swaps to sell trades. Rates vary per instrument."
  },
  {
    question: "What is margin in trading?",
    answer: "Margin is the amount of capital required to open a trade. It acts as collateral and depends on leverage, lot size, and the instrument being traded."
  }
